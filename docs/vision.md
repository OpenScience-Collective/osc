# Vision Statement

The Open Science Collective envisions a future where research software infrastructure is sustainably funded through a collaborative non-governmental organization that brings together universities, funding agencies, and research communities worldwide.

## Our Vision

We see the OSC as an independent, member-driven organization that operates like established international bodies such as ISO, TIA, and IEC, but specifically designed for the unique needs of research software sustainability. Through transparent governance, rapid decision-making, and evidence-based resource allocation, we will create a robust ecosystem where:

- **Universities and OSPOs** become active members with voting rights and governance roles
- **Technical committees** ensure quality standards and best practices across disciplines
- **Auditing bodies** provide independent oversight and accountability
- **Fast turnaround processes** deliver timely support without bureaucratic delays
- **Transparent operations** build trust through open metrics and public reporting

## Organizational Model

The OSC will function as a membership-based organization where:

1. **Institutional Members**: Universities and research institutions with OSPOs join as members, contributing funding and participating in governance
2. **Collegial Governance**: Technical committees and auditing bodies composed of domain experts ensure quality and accountability
3. **Rapid Response**: Streamlined processes enable quick funding decisions and support delivery
4. **Standards Development**: Create and maintain standards for research software quality, documentation, and sustainability
5. **Economies of Scale**: Provide shared services like security auditing, testing infrastructure, and community management that individual projects cannot afford

## Beyond Standards

While inspired by standards organizations, the OSC serves a broader mission:
- **Fund Collection and Distribution**: Systematic gathering and allocation of sustainability funding
- **Technical Oversight**: Quality assurance and best practices enforcement
- **Community Support**: Shared resources and professional development for research software engineers
- **Innovation Catalyst**: Competitive funding for breakthrough tools and methodologies

This vision transforms research software from a fragmented, volunteer-dependent ecosystem into a professionally managed, sustainably funded infrastructure that serves the global research community.
